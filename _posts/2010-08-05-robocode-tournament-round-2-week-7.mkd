The last Robocode session was held at 4PM on Monday in Bowen room. It
was much more exciting than last week's session. Besides the improved
quality of robots, the new activity - betting - played an important role
in stirring up the atmosphere. Spectators took bets on their beloved
robots, accumulating points to exchange for sweet rewards at the end.

Some interesting facts:

-   The top 3 places were won by 3 robots whose names all start with K:
    KeHuyDiet, KFC, KickAssassin, in that order.
-   KeHuyDiet, which did not leave much impression last week, surprised
    everyone by beating all opponents on its way to the title.
-   Barend, KeHuyDiet's creator, was also a prophet that won most of his
    bets.
-   The most funny match was the one between Davik and Harakiri, 2
    "lazy" robots that refused to make any move until the opponent moves
    first.
